    - text: |
          -	There are different ways to fix this problem.
          -	Check your hardware: Ensure that all cables and connections are securely plugged in.
          -	Restart your devices: Power cycle your modem/router and the device you're trying to connect to the internet.
          -	Verify connectivity: If you're using a wired connection, check if the network adapter on your device is properly recognized and enabled.
          - In Windows, you can do this by going to "Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections" and checking the status of your Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection.
          -	Disable/enable network adapter: In Windows, you can try disabling and then enabling your network adapter to refresh the connection. 
          - Right-click on the network icon in the system tray, select "Open Network & Internet Settings," then go to "Change adapter options." Right-click on your network adapter and choose "Disable." Wait a few seconds, then right-click again and choose "Enable."

    - text: |
          -	If you're having trouble connecting to Wi-Fi, here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

          - Ensure that you're entering the correct Wi-Fi password, as an incorrect password will prevent the connection.
          -	Forget and reconnect to the network: On your device, go to the Wi-Fi settings and find the network you're having trouble with.
          - Select the network and choose the option to "Forget" or "Remove" it. Then, reconnect to the network by selecting it again and entering the password.
          -	Restart your Wi-Fi router: Try restarting your Wi-Fi router by unplugging it from the power source, waiting for about 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in.
          -	Disable/enable Wi-Fi: On your device, disable Wi-Fi and then enable it again. This can help refresh the connection and resolve minor issues.
          - You can usually find this option in the Wi-Fi settings on your device.

          -	Select the VPN server: After logging in, you may need to select the VPN server or network you want to connect to.
